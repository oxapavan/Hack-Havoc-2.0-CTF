At starting i am not able to figure out where to find first part of flag. After exploring discord options, I decided to try Discord bot, and using commands, I totally played with all discord command's i get to know i can execute command & get information so i directly excuted /flag üòÅ & we all know where 2nd part of flag is located.......

> Hint's
>  Incidents in Disguise Reverse You Rock with the latest one  and try with some top you Rock list password contains: amos amos amos 
>  Incidents in Disguise You Rock You Rock You Rock  Now backtrack the file and hint XD.

This challenge i was not able to solve at starting cause don't know the password to do steganography. After Few Hint's i get to know we need to use New Rockyou.txt According to Hint's **amos** is something they stressed so i greped amos from rockyou.txt [rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt) Many people asked me which rockyou & tool need to use i suggested this one & this worked for me.

```bash
sudo apt-get install steghide -y
cat rockyou.txt | grep "amos" > pass.txt
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash
image="file.jpg"
wordlist="pass.txt"

while read password; do
    echo "Trying password: $password"
    steghide extract -sf "$image" -p "$password" -f > /dev/null 2>&1

    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "[+] Success! Password found: $password"
        exit 0
    fi
done < "$wordlist"

echo "[-] No password found in the wordlist."
```

```bash
./req.sh
```
Finally after running this you will get to know this is password is ***7¬°Vamos!**

```bash
steghide  steghide extract -sf file.jpg -p *7¬°Vamos!
cat flag.txt
```

Starting i am thinking why this weird website ??? after carefully seeing some text in picture ????? yeah...  
I had seen source page to see other pictures 

<img src="Images/Steg-1.png" alt="Challenge Image" width="200"/>


[image-1](https://sites.google.com/cybermaterial.com/lira-journey/)  
[image-2](https://sites.google.com/cybermaterial.com/lira-journey/the-woods)  
[image-3](https://sites.google.com/cybermaterial.com/lira-journey/the-woods/the-escape?authuser=0)  

After case fully seeing some text is locked in picture i tried to combined all 3 it shown something like this.  
<img src="Images/Combine.jpg" alt="Challenge Image" width="200"/>  
What is **P13ces}** Ofcource it is last 1/4th flag... what about remaining ? I had no clue what to do ....... But each image had a sequence number so i started going steganography with steghide 
They maintained a sequence you don't need any Password to extract image 1, but you need for image 2, but what is password for image 2? what ever part of flag in extracted text in image 1...... loop continues up to 4.

```bash
steghide extract -sf 1.jpg
 cat part-1-flag.txt

steghide extract -sf 2.jpg
cat part-2-flag.txt

steghide extract -sf 3.jpg
cat part-3-flag.txt

steghide extract -sf 4.jpg
cat part-4-flag.txt 
```

```bash
image - 1 ( Lira walked through the quiet village at dusk, her thoughts wandering as she crossed the old bridge.  She noticed something strange about the stone railing‚Äîa small, engraved marking. She traced her finger over it and uncovered a hidden message: **{Break_** )

image - 2 ( Deep in the forest, Lira found a strange rock formation. Beneath one of the stones, another engraving appeared: "**1t**". The pieces were falling into place, but the meaning still escaped her )

image - 3 ( As Lira ventured further, she stumbled upon an abandoned cabin. Inside, hidden in the floorboards, was yet another piece of the puzzle:  Visit this site and get your part: https://pastebin.com/V3nbr0sm.**_1int0_** The mystery was growing, and the answers seemed just out of reach.  )

image - 4 (  At last, Lira reached the heart of the forest, where a small clearing lay undisturbed. In the center, a worn parchment was pinned to the ground. Written on it was the a riddle that can contain the final clue: 

"In the realm of shapes, I‚Äôm the base of a square
In the world of shapes, I form a perfect square,
A hint lies in balance; I help you explore,
Count me well, and you‚Äôll see I am more.
I'm just a single digit number, all alone."

It dawned on her, she had to put all the pieces together to unlock the final part of the 5 pieces hidden message.

FLAG: CM{xxxxx_#x_#xxx#_#_x##xxx} )

```

<!-- -->


After seeing flag format CM{xxxxx_#x_#xxx#_#_x##xxx} i had connected all pieces P13ces}, {Break_, 1t, _1int0_.  
**CM{Break_1t_1int0_4_p13ces}**

I feel my self i sooo good at osint challenges lol üòÖ but this osint challenges didn't feel up to the mark.
Please look challenge file in **Challenge-Files/Hack Uncovered.pdf**

They clearly menctioned to search about **top threats**, **Vulnerability**, **regulations** After calefully reviewing

**Top Threats = DarkGate**  
**Vulnerability = CVE-2024-5217**  
**regulations = KOPSA**
Combining this we get flag
**CM{DarkGate_CVE-2024-5217_KOPSA}**
